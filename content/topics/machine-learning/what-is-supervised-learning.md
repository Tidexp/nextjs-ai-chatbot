# What is Supervised Learning?

**Supervised learning maps inputs to outputs from labeled examples. Common tasks: regression (predict numbers) and classification (predict categories).**

---

## Overview

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models:

- **Input**: Features (X)
- **Output**: Target/Label (y)
- **Goal**: Learn function f where f(X) ≈ y

## Types of Problems

### Regression

Predict continuous values:

- House prices
- Temperature
- Stock prices

### Classification

Predict categories:

- Spam vs. not spam
- Cat vs. dog
- Disease diagnosis

## The Learning Process

1. **Collect labeled data**: Examples with known outputs
2. **Split data**: Training and test sets
3. **Train model**: Learn patterns from training data
4. **Evaluate**: Test on unseen data
5. **Deploy**: Use model for predictions
